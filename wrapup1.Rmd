# Reproduce scheme of population --> experiment --> back

Use armpit example

## Concepts on experimental design?

- Defining Population
- Importance of Randomisation
- Sample size
- Control: simultaneous, randomizing, blinding
- What have we measured (data types?)
- Types of variables

## Data exploration

- Plots for continuous variables
- Bar plots vs boxplots
- Data as raw as possible why?
- Assessing normality
- mean vs median vs geometric mean
- standard deviation vs IQR

## Estimation / inference

- What happens when we repeat experiments?
- generalize what we see in sample?


## Basic Concepts

- Random variables
- Probability theory
- Statistical modeling
- Estimation
- Why are all our statistics/estimators random variables
- No assumptions: empirical vs assumptions

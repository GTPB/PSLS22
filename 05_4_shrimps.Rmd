# The shrimps dataset

Dataset on the accumulation of PCBs (Polychlorinated biphenyls)
in the adipose tissue of shrimps. PCBs are often present in coolants, and are 
know to accumulate easily in the adipose tissue of shrimps. In this experiment, 
two groups of 18 samples (each 100 grams) of shrimps each were cultivated 
in different conditions, one control condition and one condition 
where the medium was poluted with PCBs. Note that the PCB concentrations were 
measured in pg/g adipose tissue.

# Goal

The research question is; is there an effect of the 
growth condition on the PCB concentration in the adipose 
tissue of shrimps?

# Exercises and questions

1. Explore the data what do you observe?

2. How will you model the data? 

3. Translate the research question in a null and alternative hypothesis

4. Which test will you use to assess the research hypothesis? 

5. Formulate the assumptions of the test and assess the assumptions using 
diagnostic plots. 

6. If all assumptions to perform the test are met, complete the analysis and
formulate a proper conclusion.

# Aims

In this exercise, you will revisit the basics of statistical hypothesis testing.

You will acquire the skills

1. to assess the assumptions of a one-sample and a paired t-test in  data exploration.
2. to conduct a paired t-test in R and to interpret the results.
3. to conduct a one-sample t-test in R and to interpret the results.

# The diabetes dataset

The `diabetes`  dataset holds information on a small experiment with
8 patients that are subjected to a glucose tolerance test.

Patients had to fast for eight hours before the test.
When the patients entered the hospital their baseline glucose level was measured (mmol/l).

Patients then  had to drink 250 ml of a syrupy glucose solution containing 100
grams of sugar.  Two hours later, their blood glucose level was measured again.

The data consist of three variables:

- `before`: glucose concentration upon 8 hours of fasting (mmol/l)
- `after`: glucose concentration 2 hours after drinking glucose solution (mmol/l).
- `patient`: identifier for the patient

## Research questions

The goal is to answer two research questions;

1. Is the average glucose level after the sugar intake different from the average glucose level before sugar intake?

2. Is the average glucose level of the patients two hours after the sugar intake higher than 7.8 mmol/L?

## Import the data

First, load the required R libraries:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
diabetes <- read_delim("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/statOmics/PSLS21/data/diabetes.txt", delim = " ")
```

# Data exploration

We will start with a data exploration.
Have a first look at the raw data. How is the data structured?
Is this data *tidy*?

```{r}
glimpse(diabetes)
head(diabetes)
```

We have 8 patients, for which glucose concentrations were measured, before and after sugar intake.

Note, that the dataset is not in the tidy format. The glucose concentration
variable is spread around 2 columns: `before` and `after`, while the "time"
variable is encoded in the column names instead of in a dedicated column. Data
in this form is also called *wide* data. Instead, we want to transform the data
to a *long* format.

To tidy the data, we can use the `gather()` function to
[pivot](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html#pivoting) the data. In this case,
we want to "gather" the `time` (encoded in the column names `before` and
`after`) and `concentration` variables (which is encoded in the actual values).
The `patient` column should stay the same. We can specify this with the
following syntax.

```{r}
diabetes_tidy <- diabetes %>%
  gather(key = "time", value = "concentration", -patient)

## Take a look at the new data
glimpse(diabetes_tidy)
diabetes_tidy
```

To improve the visualizations below, we can also sligthly recode the `time` variable, so that the "before" level is the first one. We can do this by converting `time` to a factor.

```{r}
diabetes_tidy <- diabetes_tidy %>%
  mutate(
    time = as.factor(time),
    time = relevel(time, ref = "before")
  )
```

We could visualize the data using boxplots. Note, however, that we lose the
paired characteristic of the data with this visualization. Nevertheless, it is
still a useful visualization to assess any differences in mean and variance
between the two time points.

```{r}
boxplot <- diabetes_tidy %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = time, y = concentration, fill = time)) +
  theme_bw() +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.2) +
  stat_summary(
    fun = mean, geom = "point",
    shape = 5, size = 3,
    color = "black"
  ) +
  ylab("Concentration (mmol/l)")

boxplot
```

We observe that the variability of the glucose levels are higher after than
before the sugar intake.  The difference plot also shows that glucose levels in
the blood are higher for most of the patients two hours after the sugar intake.
Only for one patient the glucose concentration two hours after treatment is
lower.

To visualize the paired nature of the data, we can use a **line plot**,
connecting the `before` and `after` points for each patient.

```{r}
diabetes_tidy %>%
  ggplot(aes(time, concentration)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(aes(group = patient))
```


# Question 1

Is the glucose level after 8 hours of fasting on average different from the glucose level two hours after intake of 100g of glucose?

As the data are paired, we can expect that the measurements before and after the glucose intake are correlated.
We can illustrate this with a scatterplot.

Note that in this case, the non-tidy data is actually a more suitable format to visualize.

```{r}
diabetes %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = before, y = after)) +
  geom_point() +
  ylab("before (mmol/l)") +
  xlab("after (mmol/l)")
```

```{r}
cor(diabetes$before, diabetes$after, method = "spearman")
```


## Check the assumptions

The paired t-test has 2 assumptions:

1. The differences in glucose levels are independent of each other.

2. The differences in glucose levels are normally distributed.

The first assumption is met given the experimental design.
Upon differencing the measurements before and after the glucose intake, we obtained one difference for each patient. As the patients were sampled at random from the population we can expect them to be independent.

Secondly, we assess if the differences are normally distributed.

We can calculate the differences for each patient using a `group_by()` +
`summarize()` combination on the tidy data.

```{r}
diabetes_diff <- diabetes_tidy %>%
  group_by(patient) %>%
  summarize(difference = diff(concentration))
diabetes_diff
```

```{r}
diabetes_diff %>%
  ggplot(aes(sample = difference)) +
  geom_qq() +
  geom_qq_line()
```

Based on the QQ-plot, we may assume that our data are normally distributed.
As our assumptions are met we may continue with performing the paired t-test.

## Hypothesis test

We will perform a **paired t-test**.

- The null hypothesis of the test is that the glucose levels before and two hours after
glucose intake are on average equal.
- Which will be tested against the alternative hypothesis that the glucose levels before and two hours after the glucose intake are on average different.

```{r}
paired_t <- t.test(diabetes$after,diabetes$before, paired = TRUE)
paired_t
```


## Conclusion

There is on average an significant blood increase in the blood pressure upon
administering 100g of sugar to patients (p = `r round(paired_t$p.value, 2)`).
The glucose levels two hours after administering 100g of glucose are on average `r round(paired_t$estimate,1)` mmol/l higher than upon 8 hours of fastening
(95% CI [`r round(paired_t$conf.int,1)`]mmol/l).

# Alternative solution: One-sample t-test on the difference

Since the data is paired, we can also simply calculate the differences in
glucose level before and after sugar intake for each patient. We can then
perform a one-sample t-test on these differences, testing whether they are
significantly different from zero. This is equivalent to the paired t-test we
performed above.

We can verify this with the analysis below

```{r}
t.test(difference ~ 1, data = diabetes_diff, mu = 0)
```

Indeed, the output is equivalent to that of the paired t-test.

# Question 2

Is the average glucose level two hours after sugar intake
higher than the threshold of 7.8 mmol/l for pre-diabetes?

We can test this hypothesis using a **one-sample t-test**.
Indeed we are interested to compare the average glucose level to a known threshold for pre-diabetes.

## Assess the assumptions

Before we can perform a one sample t-test, we must check that the required
assumptions are met!

1. The observations are independent
2. The glucose levels two hours after the treatment are normally distributed

The first assumption requires us to think about how the data were collected.
Are there dependences in the data?
The 8 glucose levels upon sugar intake are collected on 8 random patients so we can assume that the glucose levels 2 hours after sugar intake are independent.

We can assess the second assumption with a quantile-quantile plot. First we need to filter the data, so we only retain the values for the `time == "after"` level

```{r}
diabetes_after <- diabetes_tidy %>%
  filter(time == "after")
```

```{r}
diabetes_after %>%
  ggplot(aes(sample = concentration)) +
  geom_qq() +
  geom_qq_line()
```

The data seem to be nicely scattered around the quantile-quantile
line (black line).
We also do not observe large deviations in the plot.

So we will assume that our data is normally
distributed.
Note, that there are not many observations to assess normality.

## Hypothesis test

Here, we will test if mean glucose level 2 hours after sugar intake is significantly
higher than the threshold for pre-diabetes of 7.8 mmol/l. More specifically, we will test the null hypothesis;

$H_0:$ the mean glucose level two hours after 100g of sugar intake is equal to 7.8 mmol/l

versus the alternative hypothesis;

$H_1:$ the mean glucose level two hours after 100g of sugar intake is greater than 7.8 mmol/l

```{r}
t_test_after <- t.test(concentration ~ 1,
  data = diabetes_after,
  mu = 7.8,
  alternative = "greater",
  conf.level = 0.95
)
t_test_after
```

## Conclusion

When writing a conclusion on your research hypothesis,
it is very important to be precise, concise, and complete.

An example of such a conclusion for our research question
is given below:

We can conclude that the mean glucose level of patients two hours after 100g of glucose intake is not significantly higher than the threshold  for pre-diabetes of 7.8 mmol/l (p = `r round(t_test_after$p.value,2)`).
The mean glucose level two hours after the intake of 100g of sugar equals `r round(t_test_after$estimate,1)` mmol/l (95% CI [`r round(t_test_after$conf.int,1)`]).

As we have seen in the theory class, the 95% confidence
interval can be interpreted as;

With 95% confidence we can conclude that the true average of glucose level of the patients in the population is above `r round(t_test_after$conf.int[1],2)`.

Note, that we only report a one sided confidence interval because we only test against the alternative hypothesis that the glucose level two hours after sugar intake is on average larger than the threshold for pre-diabetes of 7.8 mmol/l.

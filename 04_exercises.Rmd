In this hands-on tutorial session we will explore the data from
4 different studies:

* [The NHANES dataset]
* [The pertruss]
* [The captopril dataset]
* [The FEV dataset]

# The NHANES dataset

The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) contains data
that has been collected since 1960. For this tutorial, we will make use of the
data that was collected  between 2009 and  2012, for 10.000 U.S. civilians.
The dataset contains a large number of physical, demographic, nutritional and
life-style-related parameters.


The first step in a data analysis is data exploration. 

In this tutorial, you will learn howto:

- import data into R
- tidy and wrangle data 
- explore and visualize data 

by following and interpreting the code of a worked out example.

# The pertussis dataset

Researchers wanted to study the immune response on pertussis. 
They have set up an experiments with 40 rats. 
16 rats were infected with pertussis and 24 rats received a control treatment. 
Researchers measured the white blood cell concentration (WBC) in each rat (count per mm$^3$. 

De data consists of two variables:

- WBC: white blood cell count (counts/mm$^3$). 
- groep (group): 

    - 0: rat recieved control treatment
    - 1: rat was infected with pertussis

- Exercise: [Exercise2](./04_2_pertussis.html)
- Data path:

  `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/statOmics/statistiekBasisCursusData/master/practicum3/wbcon.dat`

Upon this exercise you can 

- implement a data exploration for a two group comparison in R and 
- interpret the results.

# The captopril dataset

The captopril dataset holds information on a small experiment with 15 patients
that have increased blood pressure values. More specifically, for each patient
we will have four values; one value for systolic blood pressure and one for
diastolyic, both before and after treating the patient with a drug named
captopril.

In this tutorial on data exploration, you will learn how to deal with data from
paired experimental designs.

# The FEV dataset

The FEV, which is an acronym for forced expiratory volume, is a measure of how
much air a person can exhale (in liters)  during  a forced breath. In this
dataset, the FEV of 606 children, between the ages of 6 and 17, were measured.
The dataset also provides additional information on these children:
their `age`, their `height`, their `gender` and, most importantly, whether the
child is a smoker or a non-smoker. The goal of this experiment was to find out
if smoking has an effect on the FEV of children.

In this tutorial, you will learn about the importance of confounders in
real-life datasets.

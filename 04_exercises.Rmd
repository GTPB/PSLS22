In the first day of the "Practical Statistics for the Life Sciences (2021)" 
course, we will have four exercises on data exploration, based on different 
datasets:


# The NHANES dataset:

The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) contains data 
that has been collected since 1960. For this tutorial, we will make use of the 
data that was collected  between 2009 and  2012, for 10.000 U.S. civilians. 
The dataset contains a large number of physical, demographic, nutritional and 
life-style-related parameters.

Getting familiar with the dataset will always be the first step in a data 
analysis pipeline. In this tutorial, you will learn the key principles of data 
exploration in R, including data import, tidying, wrangling and visualisation.

# The armpit dataset:

Smelly armpits are not caused by sweat, itself. The smell is caused by specific 
micro-organisms belonging to the group of Corynebacterium spp. that metabolise 
sweat. Another group of abundant bacteria are the Staphylococcus spp., which do
not metabolise sweat in smelly compounds.

The CMET-group at Ghent University does research on transplanting the armpit 
microbiome to help people with smelly armpits. To test the effect of 
transplanting the microbiome, they conducted an experiment on two groups 
of volunteers: one group was treated with a placebo, while the other had a 
microbiome transplant. The goal was to assess whether a microbial transplant can affect the relative abundance of Staphylococcus spp. in the microbiome of the armpit.

In this exercise, you will use your acquired skills from the first exercise to 
explore the armpit dataset all by yourself!

# The captopril dataset:

The captopril dataset holds information on a small experiment with 15 patients 
that have increased blood pressure values. More specifically, for each patient 
we will have four values; one value for systolic blood pressure and one for 
diastolyic, both before and after treating the patient with a drug named 
captopril.

In this tutorial on data exploration, you will learn how to deal with data from 
paired experimental designs.

# The FEV dataset:

The FEV, which is an acronym for forced expiratory volume, is a measure of how 
much air a person can exhale (in liters)  during  a forced breath. In this 
dataset, the FEV of 606 children, between the ages of 6 and 17, were measured. 
The dataset also provides additional information on these children: 
their `age`, their `height`, their `gender` and, most importantly, whether the 
child is a smoker or a non-smoker. The goal of this experiment was to find out 
if smoking has an effect on the FEV of children.

In this tutorial, you will learn about the importance of confounders in 
real-life datasets.

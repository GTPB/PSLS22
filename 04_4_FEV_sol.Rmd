# Aims

In this tutorial, you will learn how data exploration and plots can help you to discover confounding in a real datasets.

You will also improve your data wrangling skills by importing, tidying, wrangling and visualizing data yourself.


# The FEV dataset

The `forced expiratory volume` (FEV)
is a measure of how much air a person can exhale (in liters)
during  a forced breath. In this dataset, the FEV of 606 children,
between the ages of 6 and 17, were measured. The dataset
also provides additional information on these children:
their `age`, their `height`, their `gender` and, most
importantly, whether the child is a smoker or a non-smoker.

The goal of this experiment was to find out whether or not
smoking has an effect on the FEV of children.

Note: to analyse this dataset properly, we will need some
relatively advanced modeling techniques. At the end of this
week, you will have seen all three required steps to analyse
such a dataset! For now, we will limit ourselves to exploring
the data.

# Load libraries

If you do not have these libraries installed, make sure to install them first
by using the `install.packages()` function with missing the package name inside
the parentheses (and using quotation marks, like `install.packages("car")`)

```{r, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(car)
```

# Import the data

Note: `fev.txt` is a tab-separated file: make sure to select the correct `readr`
function!

```{r}
fev <- read_tsv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/statOmics/PSLS21/data/fev.txt")
head(fev)
```

# Data wrangling

There are a few things in the formatting of the
data that can be improved:

1. Both `gender` and `smoking` can be transformed to factors.

2. The `height` variable is written in inches. Assuming that
this audience is mainly Portuguese/Belgian, inches are hard to
interpret. Let's add a new column, `height_cm`, with the values
converted to centimeters.

```{r}
fev <- fev %>%
  mutate(gender = as.factor(gender)) %>%
  mutate(smoking = as.factor(smoking)) %>%
  mutate(height_cm = height * 2.54)

head(fev)
```

That's better!

# Data exploration

Now, let's make a first explorative plot, showing
only the FEV for both smoking categories.

Which type of plot do you suggest?

```{r}
fev %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = smoking, y = fev, fill = smoking)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("dimgrey", "firebrick")) +
  theme_bw() +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, size = 0.1) +
  ggtitle("Boxplot of FEV versus smoking") +
  ylab("FEV (l)") +
  xlab("smoking status")
```

Did you expect these results?

It appears that children that smoke have a higher
median FEV than children that do not smoke.

```{r}
fev %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = fev, color = smoking)) +
    geom_point( size = 0.1) + 
    geom_smooth()
```

The trends in the plot seems to match much more with our expectations. 

First, it seems
that we do not have any smoking children of ages 6, 7 or 8.
Second, it no longer seems that smokers have a higher FEV
than non-smokers; on the contrary smoking seems to lead to a lower lung capacity for the elder pupils.

This shows that accounting for important confounders
(in this case age) is crucial! If we simply analysed based on
the smoking status and FEV values only, we would have made wrong conclusions.

Can we provide additional insights in the data, e.g. by accounting for other useful explanatory variables?

```{r}
fev %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = fev, color = smoking)) +
    geom_point(size=0.1) + 
    geom_smooth() +
    facet_grid(cols = vars(gender))
```

This plot holds one extra level of information, the gender
of the child. Especially for higher ages, the FEV
is higher for males as compared to females.

The only source of information that is lacking is `height`.
We could simply make a
scatterplot displaying the FEV in function of a child's
height (in cm). Additionally, we could color the dots based
on gender and making two plots according to the smoking status.

```{r}
fev %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = height_cm, y = fev, color = gender)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorchid", "olivedrab4")) +
  theme_bw() +
  ggtitle("Boxplot of FEV versus height") +
  ylab("FEV (l)") +
  xlab("Height (cm)") +
  facet_grid(cols = vars(smoking))
```

There is a clear relationship between height and FEV.
In addition, we see that for the large height values
(>175cm), we mainly find male subjects.

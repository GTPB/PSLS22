# The poison dataset

In this experiment, 96 fish (dojofish, goldfish and zebrafish)
were placed separately in a tank with two liters of water and
a certain dose (in mg) of the poison EI-43,064. The resistance
of the fish against the poison was measured as the amount of
minutes the fish survived after being exposed to the poison (`Surv_time`, in
minutes). Additionally, the weight of each fish was measured.

# Goal

In this tutorial session we will focus on **Dojofish**, and we will model the 
survival time in function of the poison dose while correcting for the weight of 
the fish. 

1. We will first analyse the survival data by only considering the dose as an
explanatory variable for survival time

2. Next we will model the survival data with and additive model for dose and 
weight

Load libraries

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
#install.packages("GGally")
library(GGally)
library(car)
library(multcomp)
```

# Import the data

```{r, message=FALSE}
poison <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/statOmics/PSLS21/data/poison.csv")
```

# Data tidying

We can see a couple of things in the data that can be improved:

1. Capitalise the fist column name

3. Set the Species column as a factor

4. Change the species factor levels from "0" to Dojofish. 
*Hint*: use the `fct_recode` function.

4. In the previous analysis on this dataset 
(`Simple linear regression session`), we performed a log-transformation on the 
response variable `Surv_time` to meet the normality and homoscedasticity 
assumptions of the linear model. Here, we will immediately work with 
log-transformed survival times; store these in the new  variable `log2Surv_time`
and remove the non-transformed values.

5. Subset the data to only retain **Dojofish**.

```{r}
poison <- poison %>%
  rename("Species" = "species") %>%
  mutate(Species = as.factor(Species)) %>%
  mutate(Species = fct_recode(Species, Dojofish = "0", Goldfish = "1", Zebrafish = "2")) %>%
  mutate(log2Surv_time = Surv_time %>% log2) %>%
  dplyr::select(-Surv_time) %>%
  filter(Species=="Dojofish")

poison
```

# Data exploration

Prior to the analysis, we should explore our data. To start our data 
exploration, we will make use of the `ggpairs` function of the
`GGally` R package. This function will generate a visualization containing
multiple panels, which display (1) univariate plots of the different variables
in our dataset, (2) bivariate plots and (3) correlation coefficients between 
the different variables.

```{r, message=FALSE}
poison %>%
  ggpairs + theme_bw()
```

Based on these plots, we observe that:

- The survival time seems to be associated with dose and fish weight.

From the tutorial of H6 we have seen that the fish weights were not nicely 
uniform across the different poison dosages due to the randomisation.

```{r, message=FALSE}
poison %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Dose, y = Weight)) +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Association between dose and weight") +
  theme_bw() + 
  stat_summary(
    geom = "point",
    fun = "mean",
    col = "black",
    size = 4,
    shape = 24,
    fill = "red")
```

# Simple linear regression 

This is the same regression model that we have already fit in the exercise 
session on simple linear regression, with `Dose` as the only explanatory 
variable for `log2Surv_time`.

```{r}
# fit a linear regression model with 'Surv_time' as response variable and
# 'Dose' as predictor variabele
lm_simple <- lm(log2Surv_time ~ Dose, data=poison) 

## display the diagnostic plots of the model
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(lm_simple)
```

1. The independence assumption was **met** because the fish were randomized to 
the dose.
2. The linearity assumption is **met**.
3. The normality assumption is **met**.
4. The homoscedasticity assumption is **met**.

Finally, we look at the output of the model.

```{r}
summary(lm_simple)
```

Or for an interpretation at the original scale (minutes in stead of log2 
minutes):

```{r}
2^(lm_simple$coef)["Dose"]
2^(confint(lm_simple))[2,]
```

There is a very significant effect of the poison on survival of Dojofish 
(p< 0.001). Dojofish that are exposed to a higher dose of the poison will 
have a survival time that decrease on average with a factor 
`r lm_simple$coef[2] %>% 2^. %>% round(.,2)` per gram of poison that 
is added (95% CI [`r confint(lm_simple)[2,] %>% 2^. %>% round(.,2)`]).

# Analysis with additive effect for weight

## Model specification

Here, we will estimate the effect of the poison while correcting for `weight` 
and we will add it as an additional covariate to our linear regression model, 
such that

$$
y_i=\beta_0+\beta_d x_d + \beta_g x_g + \epsilon_i,
$$

with $\epsilon_i \text{ i.i.d. } N(0,\sigma^2)$.

## Assumptions

The model will again be fit to allow for assessing the model assumptions

```{r}
lm_additive <- lm(log2Surv_time ~ Dose + Weight, data = poison)
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(lm_additive)
```

The assumption of independence, linearity and homoscedasticity are met.

The QQ-plot suggest that there might be some deviation from normality in the 
left tail of the,distribution. However, when we would simulate data under the 
normality assumption, it seems that deviations of this size may be expected when
normality is met. We will use simulation to assess if we can observe similar 
residual plots if all assumptions for the linear model hold.

```{r}
set.seed(1031)
sigma <- lm_additive %>% sigma 

dataHlp <- poison
simModels <- list()

par(mfrow=c(3,3))
for (i in 1:9)
{
  nobs <- poison %>% nrow
  dataHlp$ySim <- lm_additive$fit + rnorm(nobs, sd = sigma)
  simModels[[i]] <- lm(ySim~Dose + Weight, dataHlp)
  plot(simModels[[i]], which = 2)
}
```
It seems that deviations of the size that we see in our real data may be 
expected even when normality is met. As such, all assumptions for linear 
regression seem to be valid.

## Inference

We then inspect the results.

```{r}
summary(lm_additive)
```

## Interpretation of model parameters

We see that the effect of dose on survival time remains similar, however, it 
has become more significant after we have incorporated weight in our model. 
Indeed, from the data exploration, we learned that weight is associated with 
survival. 

1. As such, by incorporating weight in our model, we are able to
explain a larger part of the variability in the response variable survival time.
As a consequence, the variability in the residuals of the model will decrease,
which in turn will lead to smaller standard error estimates for the different
parameter estimates in the model.

2. From the data exploration, we additionally found that the dojo-fish weights
were not uniform across the different poison dosages due to the randomisation. 
Therefore, we can estimate the effect between dose and survival time better 
while accounting for the weight.

In this model, the effect of `Dose` can be interpreted as the average change in
the log2 survival time between two groups of dojofish **with the same weight** 
that are exposed to a poison dosage that differs 1 mg/L. In symbols:

\begin{eqnarray}
\hat{\mu_1}&=& \beta_0 + \beta_d x_{1d} + \beta_g x_g \text{ (average log2-survival time for dose 1 for a certain weight)}\\
\hat{\mu_2}&=& \beta_0 + \beta_d x_{2d} + \beta_g x_g \text{ (average log2-survival time for dose 2 for that same weight)}\\
\hat \mu_2- \hat \mu_1&=&\beta_0 + \beta_d x_{2d} + \beta_g x_g - (\beta_0 + \beta_d x_{1d} + \beta_g x_g) \text{ (difference in average log2-survival time between dose 2 en dose 1)}\\ 
\hat \mu_2-\hat \mu_1&=&\beta_d (x_{2d}-x_{1d})
\end{eqnarray}

## Conclusion

```{r}
2^(lm_additive$coef)
2^(confint(lm_additive))
```

The dose of the poison has an extremely significant effect on the log2
transformed survival time of dojofish 
(p-value = `r format(summary(lm_additive)$coefficients[2,4],digits=1)`). The 
geometric average of the survival time for dojofish that are exposed to a 
poison dose that is 1mg/L larger is approximately halved (factor = $2^{\beta_d}=$ `r format(2^(lm_additive$coef["Dose"]),digits=2)`) .

The effect of weight on the survival time of dojofish is also extremely 
significant 
(p-value = `r format(summary(lm_additive)$coefficients[3,4],digits=1)`). The
geometric average of the survival time of a dojofish that weighs 1 gram more 
than another dojofish is approximately twice as long 
(factor = $2^{ \beta_g}$= `r format(2^(lm_additive$coef["Weight"]),digits=2)`, 
95% BI [`r paste(format(2^(confint(lm_additive)["Weight",]),digits=2),collapse=",")`]).

## Remarks

In the `lm_additive` model, we included only a *main effect* for weight. 
However, there could also be an *interaction effect* between weight and
dose. An interaction between weight and dose implies that the dose effect on 
the survival time changes according to the weight of the fish.

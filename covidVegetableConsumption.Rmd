"The authors state: The negative ecological association between COVID-19 mortality and the consumption of cabbage and cucumber supports the a priori hypothesis previously reported.
In this hypothesis, we proposed that vegetables such as Brassica - with an antioxidant activity reducing insulin resistance - may also be associated with low COVID-19 mortality in countries.
"

"
Though our results do not allow to infer causality, they do reinforce our a priory hypothesis that the ingestion of anti-oxidant foods acting on insulin intolerance may have reduced the severity of COVID-19.

- Many hypotheses are assessed ?!
- Causality ?!
- Experimental design: Observational study
- Based on the data we cannot provide recommendations at the subject level

- Importance of Data Exploration!
- Data does not exhibit the trend
- Data shows evidence for two clusters: above and below 200 deaths/million
- Model for cucumber does not model the data correctly: Overestimation of death rate for many countries e.g. Portugal, Hungary, ...

In the example we covered issues with three important branches in statistics

1. Statistical inference

  - Is there an association between  COVID-19 mortality and food consumption?
  - Issue in study:
      - data dredging, p-hacking, ...: when you assess many hypotheses you will allways find strong patterns by random change $\rightarrow$ correct for multiple testing!
      - Assumptions of the models do not hold
      - Confounding

2. Experimental design

    - Confounding: countries do not only differ in consumption of a vegetable but also in may other variables (demographical, COVID measures, healty care, ...) that are associated with COVID mortality.

    - Difficult to draw causal conclusions from observational studies.

    - In experimental studies: randomisation! $\rightarrow$ so that  the groups only differ in the treatment.

    - Experimental studies are therefore the golden standard

3. Data exploration and visualisation

    - Crucial to get insight in the data!
    - Assess model assumptions

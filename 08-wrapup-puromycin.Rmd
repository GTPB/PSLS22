# Puromycin data

Data on the velocity of an enzymatic reaction were obtained by Treloar (1974).
The number of counts per minute of radioactive product from the reaction was
measured as a function of substrate concentration in parts per million (ppm) and
from these counts the initial rate (or velocity) of the reaction was calculated (counts/min/min). The experiment was conducted once with the enzyme treated
with Puromycin, and once with the enzyme untreated.

Assess if there is an association between the substrate concentration and rate
**for both the treated and untreated enzymes.**

# Import data

```{r}
data(Puromycin)
```

# Data wrangling

For a clearer interpretation of the model parameters later on, we will make
the untreated state enzymes the reference category.

```{r}
Puromycin <- Puromycin %>%
  mutate(state = fct_relevel(state, c("untreated", "treated")))
```

## Data Exploration

First, we visualize the association between the concentration and the enzyme
rate, for both of the enzyme states.

```{r}
Puromycin %>%
  ggplot(aes(conc, rate,col=state)) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(
    x = "Substrate concentration (ppm)",
    y = "Reaction rate (counts/min/min)"
  ) +
  ggtitle("Reaction rates for puromycin-treated enzymes")
```

The plot shows that there is a relation between the velocity and the
concentration, however, the relation does not seem to be linear.

We will assess the impact of log-transforming the concentration. Because the
concentration is measured in ppm we will log$_{10}$ transform the data.

```{r}
Puromycin %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = log10(conc), y = rate,col=state)) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_smooth(method = "lm") +
    labs(
      x = "Substrate concentration (log10(ppm))",
      y = "Reaction rate (counts/min/min)"
    ) +
    ggtitle("Reaction rates for puromycin-treated enzymes")
```

The relation between the velocity and the log$_{10}$ transformed concentration
seems to be linear.

```{r}
Puromycin <- Puromycin %>%
  mutate(log10conc = log10(conc))
```

# Linear regression

We will fit the following model to the data

$Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_c x_c+ \beta_s x_s +\beta_{c:s}x_{c}x_{s} + \epsilon_i$

with

- $Y_i$ the reaction rate,

- $\beta_0$ the intercept,

- $\beta_{c}$ the main effect for log10 concentration,

- $x_c$ the log10 concentration,

- $\beta_{p}$ the main effect for treatment ,

- $x_s$ a dummy variable for "state" that is 0 if the enzymes that are untreated and 1 if
the enzymes are treated with Puromycin,

- $\beta_{c:s}$ the interaction effect between concentration and treatment state,

- $\epsilon_i$ i.i.d. normally distributed with mean 0 and variance $\sigma^2$.

Note, that we write the substrate concentration with a small letter because
the predictor is not random. The researchers have chosen the substrate
concentrations in the design phase and it is thus no random variable.

The model implies two different regression lines

- no treatment ($x_s = 0$)
$$
Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_c x_c + \epsilon
$$
- treatment (x_s = 1)

$$
Y_i = (\beta_0 + \beta_s)  + (\beta_c+\beta_{c:s}) x_c + \epsilon
$$

So the main effect for treatment has the interpretation as the change in intercept between treated and untreated samples.

The interaction term has the interpretation as the change in slope between treated and untreated samples.


## Intermezzo: Graphical interpretation of the parameters

### Simple linear model: 1 slope {-}

This is the same model that we fit in the
[Chapter 6 exercise](./06_1_puromycin.html):

$$ Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_{\text{rate}} X_{i, \text{rate}} + \epsilon_i $$

```{r}
mod_simple <- lm(rate ~ log10conc, data = Puromycin)
mod_simple

ggplot(Puromycin, aes(log10conc, rate)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = state)) +
  geom_abline(
     intercept = coef(mod_simple)[1],
     slope = coef(mod_simple)[2]
  ) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorchid", "forestgreen")) +
  ggtitle("The simple linear model")
```


### Additive model: 2 parallel slopes {-}

We add an additional term for the state of the reactin (treated or untreated).
Note that this variable is **categorical**.

$$
Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_{\text{rate}} X_{i, \text{rate}} +
  \beta_{\text{state}} X_{i, \text{state}} + \epsilon_i
$$

```{r}
mod_add <- lm(rate ~ log10conc + state, data = Puromycin)
mod_add

ggplot(Puromycin, aes(log10conc, rate, col = state)) +
  geom_point() +
  ## Line for the untreated group
  geom_abline(
     intercept = coef(mod_add)[1],
     slope = coef(mod_add)[2],
     col = "darkorchid"
  ) +
  ## Line for the treated group
  geom_abline(
     intercept = coef(mod_add)[1] + coef(mod_add)[3],
     slope = coef(mod_add)[2],
     col = "forestgreen"
  ) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorchid", "forestgreen")) +
  ggtitle("The additive linear model with parallel slopes")
```


### The interaction model: 2 non-parallel slopes {-}

$$
Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_{\text{rate}} X_{i, \text{rate}} +
  \beta_{\text{state}} X_{i, \text{state}} +
  \beta_{\text{rate:state}} X_{i, \text{rate}} X_{i, \text{state}} +
  \epsilon_i
$$

```{r}
mod_int <- lm(rate ~ log10conc * state, data = Puromycin)
mod_int

ggplot(Puromycin, aes(log10conc, rate, col = state)) +
  geom_point() +
  ## Line for the untreated group
  geom_abline(
     intercept = coef(mod_int)[1],
     slope = coef(mod_int)[2],
     col = "darkorchid"
  ) +
  ## Line for the treated group
  geom_abline(
     intercept = coef(mod_int)[1] + coef(mod_int)[3],
     slope = coef(mod_int)[2] + coef(mod_int)[4],
     col = "forestgreen"
  ) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorchid", "forestgreen")) +
  ggtitle("The linear model with interaction: non-parallel slopes")
```

```{r}
mod1 <- lm(rate ~ log10conc * state, Puromycin)
summary(mod1)
```

Before we perform inference we will first assess the assumptions

## Assumptions


1. Linearity and representative sample 

\[E[\hat \beta_j]=\beta_j\]

2. Normal distribution of the residuals

\[Y_{i} \sim N(\mu_i,\sigma^2)\]
\[Y_i \sim N(\beta_0 + \beta_c x_{ci}+ \beta_s x_{si} +\beta_{c:s}x_{ci}x_{si},\sigma^2)  \longrightarrow \hat \beta_j \sim N(\beta_j, \sigma^2_{\hat \beta_j})\]

linear combinations of model parameter estimators are also normally distributed, e.g.
$$
\longrightarrow \hat \beta_c + \hat \beta_{c:s} \sim N(\beta_c+\beta_{cs}, \sigma^2_{\hat\beta_c+\hat\beta_{c:s}})
$$
$$
\longrightarrow L^T\hat \beta \sim N(L^T\beta, \sigma^2_{L^T\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}})
$$



4. Independence and Homoscedasticity

We assume that the experiment was well designed and that the different reactions that were use in the experiment are independent.

$$\sigma^2_{L^T\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}} = c_L \sigma^2$$


- $\sigma^2?$

$$\hat \sigma^2 = MSE = \sum\limits_{i=1} ^ n \frac{(Y_i - \hat Y_i)^2}{n-p}$$

$$
SE_{L^T\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}} = c_L \hat \sigma^2
$$

- t statistiek

$$
T = \frac{L\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}} - L\boldsymbol{\beta}}{\text{SE}_{L\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}}}
 \sim t_{n-p}
$$

- CI and T-test $H_0: L\boldsymbol{\beta} = 0$ vs  $H_1: L\boldsymbol{\beta} \neq 0$

- F statistic follows F-distribution under $H_0$
\[ F = \frac{MSR_2 - MSR_1}{MSE} \sim F_{p_2 - p_1,n-p_2}\]


### Linearity

We assess linearity in a residual analysis

```{r}
plot(mod1, which = 1)
```

The assumption of linearity is met.

### Normality

```{r}
plot(mod1, which = 2)
```

The QQ-plot does not show large deviations from normality.

### Homoscedasticity: equality of the variance

We can again use the residual plot for assessing this assumption or the plot
were we plot the square root of the standardized residuals in function of
the fit.

```{r}
plot(mod1, which = 1)
plot(mod1, which = 3)
```

We see that the spread of the majority of the residuals is more or less similar.
As such, we may assume homoscedasticity of the data.



## Inference

We first do an omnibus test to assess is there is an effect of the log10 concentration on the velocity.

```{r}
mod0 <- lm(rate ~ state, data = Puromycin)
anova(mod0, mod1)
```

Next, we assess the interaction.

```{r}
anova(mod1)
```

We cannot remove the interaction of the model.

Hence, we cannot study the effect of the concentration without accounting for the treatment and have to assess following research questions.

1. the association between velocity and the concentration is significant in the untreated group

$$
H_0: \beta_c = 0 \text{ vs } H_1: \beta_c \neq 0
$$

2. the association between velocity and the concentration is significant in the treated group

$$
H_0: \beta_c + \beta_{c:s}= 0 \text{ vs } H_1: \beta_c + \beta_{c:s}\neq 0
$$

3. the association between velocity and the concentration is different between treated and untreated group

$$
H_0: \beta_{c:s}= 0\text{ vs }H_1: \beta_{c:s}\neq 0
$$

We can assess all these hypotheses using multcomp while correcting for multiple testing.

```{r}
library(multcomp)
mcp1 <- glht(mod1,
  linfct = c(
    "log10conc = 0",
    "log10conc + log10conc:statetreated = 0",
    "log10conc:statetreated = 0"
  )
)
summary(mcp1)
confint(mcp1)
```


## Conclusion

There is an extremely significant effect of the substrate concentration on the reaction rate (p<<0.001).
The effect of the substrate concentration on the reaction rate is extremely significant for reactions catalysed with untreated enzymes. A reaction at a substrate concentration that is 10 times higher will have a reaction speed that is on average  `r round(confint(mcp1)$confint[1,1],1)` counts/min higher (95% CI [`r round(confint(mcp1)$confint[1,-1],1)`] counts/min) (p << 0.001).
The effect of the substrate concentration on the reaction rate is extremely significant for reactions catalysed puromycin treated enzymes  (p << 0.001). A reaction at a substrate concentration that is 10 times higher will have a reaction speed that is on average  `r round(confint(mcp1)$confint[2,1],1)` counts/min higher (95% CI [`r round(confint(mcp1)$confint[2,-1],1)`] counts/min).
The effect of the substrate concentration on the reaction rate is very significantly higher for reactions catalysed with Puromycin treated enzymes than when catalysed with non-treated enzymes  (p = `r round(summary(mcp1)$test$pvalue[3],3)`). A reaction at a substrate concentration that is 10 times higher will have a reaction speed that is on average `r round(confint(mcp1)$confint[3,1],1)` counts/min higher for reactions that are catalysed with Puromycin treated enzymes than with untreated enzymes (95% CI [`r round(confint(mcp1)$confint[3,-1],1)`] counts/min).

$$
Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_v x_{iv} + \beta_w x_{iw} +\beta_s x_{is} + \beta_{vw} x_{iv}x_{iw} +\epsilon_i
$$

---

Patient with a 1 unit difference in $X_v$ have an average difference in lpsa of

$$
\begin{array}{l}
E(Y | X_v=x_v +1, X_w=x_w, X_s=x_s) - E(Y | X_v=x_v, X_w=x_w, X_s=x_s) \\
\quad = \left[\beta_0 + \beta_v (x_{v}+1) + \beta_w x_w +\beta_s x_{s} + \beta_{vw} (x_{v}+1) x_w \right] - \left[\beta_0 + \beta_v x_{v} + \beta_w x_w  + \beta_s x_{s} + \beta_{vw} (x_{v}) x_w \right]\\
\quad = \beta_v +  \beta_{vw} x_w
 \end{array}
 $$

- Slope for lcavol depends on log weight of prostate!

- We can do the same for the lweight. Slope for lweight depends on lcavol of prostate!
